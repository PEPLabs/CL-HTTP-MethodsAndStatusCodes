# Methods and Status Codes Lab

# Description
In this lab we have the incomplete `getJavalinInstance()` method that creates a Javalin object, sets up an endpoint, and returns the Javalin object. Your goal is to finish the method by setting up its remaining endpoints as well as their associated handlers.

An example of an endpoint and a handler are provided in the code.

# Where to Start

You will be editing the file `Main.java`. It can be found under the `src/main/java/com/revature` package.

Review the file's code and code comments. Look for TODO comments: these comments represent the tasks you need to perform to complete the lab. You can find a list of the TODOs in VSCode's Problems pane. To open up the Problems pane, go to View > Problems or use the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + M" (or "Command + Shift + M" on Mac). We suggest you remove the TODOs as you complete them.
